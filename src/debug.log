You are asked to come up with a set of {num samples} diverse questions on {task}.
Please follow these guiding principles when generating responses:
* Use proper grammar and punctuation.
* Always generate safe and respectful content. Do not generate content that is harmful, abusive, or
offensive.
* Always generate content that is factually accurate and relevant to the prompt.
* The questions should be clear and human-like.
* The questions should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics.
* The questions should not be template-based or generic, it should be very diverse.
* Simply return the questions, do not return any answers or explanations.

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the answer provided by an AI assistant
to the questions displayed below. Evaluate whether or not the answer is a good example of how AI
Assistant should respond to the user’s instruction. Please assign a score using the following 3-point
scale:
1: It means the answer is incorrect, irrelevant, unsafe or provides incomplete and garbage information.
For instance, the answer may be factually wrong, off-topic, or filled with irrelevant content that
doesn’t address the user’s question or it could be incomplete and hanging. It may also include any
harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, explicit, offensive, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.

Additionally, I found the following documents that may be relevant to this inquiry:

1:
You are asked to come up with a set of {num samples} diverse questions on {task}.
Please follow these guiding principles when generating responses:
* Use proper grammar and punctuation.
* Always generate safe and respectful content. Do not generate content that is harmful, abusive, or
offensive.
* Always generate content that is factually accurate and relevant to the prompt.
* The questions should be clear and human-like.
* The questions should be diverse and cover a wide range of topics.
* The questions should not be template-based or generic, it should be very diverse.
* Simply return the questions, do not return any answers or explanations.

Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the answer provided by an AI assistant
to the questions displayed below. Evaluate whether or not the answer is a good example of how AI
Assistant should respond to the user’s instruction. Please assign a score using the following 3-point
scale:
1: It means the answer is incorrect, irrelevant, unsafe or provides incomplete and garbage information.
For instance, the answer may be factually wrong, off-topic, or filled with irrelevant content that
doesn’t address the user’s question or it could be incomplete and hanging. It may also include any
harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, explicit, offensive, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.
